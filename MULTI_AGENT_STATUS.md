## Q&A & Clarifications

### Q: Are the agents fully functional?
**A:** Yes. The core reasoning engine (ReAct) and all 11 specialized agents are fully implemented. They can now execute tools, query data, and generate insights autonomously.

### Q: What is the current status of LLM integration?
**A:** Multi-provider support is live. The system can switch between OpenAI (GPT-4) and Anthropic (Claude 3) based on the agent's task complexity.

### Q: Can agents work offline?
**A:** For Phase 1 (development), yes. Production will use cloud LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) for best quality. On-premises options (Ollama, LLaMA) available as fallback.

### Q: How do agents handle conflicting recommendations?
**A:** Consensus algorithm synthesizes agent outputs. Divergent perspectives are flagged for human review with confidence scores.

### Q: Timeline to full 11-agent deployment?
**A:** ✅ Phase 2 is complete. All 11 agents are implemented and verified. Phase 3 (Production Scaling) is the current focus.

## Next Steps (Phase 3: Production & Scaling)

1. **Deploy to Kubernetes** for agent scaling.
2. **Implement Message Queue** for asynchronous agent communication.
3. **Set up Distributed Tracing** with Jaeger.
4. **Establish Agent Governance** and permission models.
5. **Real-world testing** with production API keys.
