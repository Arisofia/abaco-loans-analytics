  - Q4-25: Oct $7,171K (-2.7%), Nov $6,819K (-4.9%), Dec $6,465K (-5.5%) | total -12.3% (platform build, wind-down).
  - Q1-26: Jan $8,736K (+35.1% inflection, embedded live), Feb $8,814K (+0.9%), Mar $10,364K (+17.6%) | +60.3% vs trough.

With ~60-day rotation (~6x annually) and 75% eligibility, annualized TAM is ~$12,470M of financable private-sector invoices.
