# ABACO Slide Assets

- **Theme:** Dark gradients with neon purple/blue accents to mirror the Figma “Dark Editable Slides”.
- **Growth path:** See the interactive chart exported as `growth-path.html`.
- **Marketing treemap:** Use `sales-treemap.html` to explain segment weighting.
- **Financeable offers:** Emphasize that the pipeline highlights financeable borrowers and packages, not just raw demand.
- **Data source:** Import the CSV produced by `streamlit_app.py` (download fact table from the app).
- **Compliance & auditability:** Call out the AI guardrails and decision traceability supporting regulatory readiness.
- **Narrative:** Focus on delinquency control, yield expansion, and operational automation.

Use the HTML files as iframe backgrounds or screenshot them for Figma. Keep the markdown text for slide captions, KPIs, and spotlight highlights.
