## What Happened

### The 4-Week Transformation
1. **Week 1**: Built & tested unified V2 pipeline (29 tests, 100% pass rate)
2. **Week 2**: Validated V2 against production data (0.25-3.23% variance acceptable)
3. **Week 3**: Staged to production, shadow mode testing, stress tested (45,344 iterations, zero errors)
4. **Week 4**: Executed production cutover, validated post-deployment

### Week 4 Execution Timeline
- **01:58:46 UTC**: Production cutover script started
- **01:58:50 UTC**: All 5 phases complete (4 seconds)
  - Phase 0: Pre-cutover validation ✓
  - Phase 1: Backup & snapshots ✓
  - Phase 2: V2 staging validation ✓
  - Phase 3: V1 graceful shutdown ✓
  - Phase 4: V2 activation ✓
  - Phase 5: Post-cutover validation ✓
- **01:59:56 UTC**: Hour 1 validation report generated
- **02:00:00 UTC**: Decision point: PROCEED TO MONITORING ✓

## Operations Team Responsibilities

### Right Now (Next 24 Hours)

**Your primary job**: Monitor the V2 pipeline using documented procedures.

**Required Actions**:
1. Use **WEEK4_24HOUR_MONITORING.md** as your playbook
2. Run validation every 30-60 minutes (Hours 2-8)
3. Run validation every 2-4 hours (Hours 8-24)
4. Record metrics in the provided log template
5. Watch for alert conditions

**The Command**:
```bash
cd /Users/jenineferderas/Documents/abaco-loans-analytics
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/production_validation.py
# Output → production_validation_report.json
```

**What Success Looks Like**:
- Status: PASS (all 5 checks)
- Latency: <100ms (we're at 0.65ms)
- Error rate: 0%
- No alerts triggered

---

## Critical Procedures

### If Something Looks Wrong

**Step 1**: Check the alert condition in WEEK4_24HOUR_MONITORING.md
```
Latency > 100ms?  → Escalate to Data Ops
Error rate > 5%?   → Emergency escalation (VP Engineering)
Data loss?         → Immediate rollback
```

**Step 2**: Gather information
```bash
# Check recent logs
tail -50 logs/cutover_20251226_015846.log

# Review validation report
cat production_validation_report.json | jq '.'

# Check system resources
top -n 1 | head -15
```

**Step 3**: Escalate appropriately
- Engineering Lead (for questions)
- Data Ops (for performance issues)
- VP Engineering (for critical incidents)

### If You Need to Rollback (EMERGENCY ONLY)

**This should be VERY rare.** Only if:
- Error rate sustained >5% for >5 minutes
- Data loss confirmed
- V2 crashes repeatedly with no recovery

**Step 1**: Stop V2
```bash
systemctl stop abaco-pipeline-v2 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Step 2**: Restore V1
```bash
cp .rollback/pipeline_backup_*.yml config/pipeline.yml
cp -r .rollback/metrics_backup/* data/metrics/
systemctl start abaco-pipeline-v1
```

**Step 3**: Notify leadership
- Email VP Engineering with incident report
- Include: timestamp, error messages, metrics at time of rollback

**Expected**: <5 minutes to full recovery with zero data loss

## Your Monitoring Checklist

### Hour 2-8 (Every 30-60 minutes)
- [ ] Run validation script
- [ ] Check JSON output for "status": "PASS"
- [ ] Record metrics (latency, error rate)
- [ ] No alerts triggered?
- [ ] Yes → Continue to next checkpoint

### Hour 8 Decision Point
- [ ] Review all 6 hour-long monitoring records
- [ ] All checks passed?
  - YES → Move to 2-4 hour interval monitoring
  - NO → Investigate anomalies, escalate if needed

### Hour 8-24 (Every 2-4 hours)
- [ ] Run validation script
- [ ] Review output for PASS
- [ ] No trending toward alerts?
- [ ] Yes → Continue to next checkpoint

### Hour 24 Final Sign-Off
- [ ] All 24 checks passed?
- [ ] No critical incidents?
- [ ] Baseline metrics stable?
- [ ] YES → Project successful, hand off to steady-state ops

## Timeline & Decision Points

```
Hour 0  ✓ Cutover completed
    ↓
Hour 1  ✓ Validation checkpoint: PASS
    ↓
Hour 8  → Decision Point #1: Stability?
    ├─ YES → Reduce monitoring frequency
    └─ NO → Investigate & escalate
    ↓
Hour 24 → Decision Point #2: Ready for handoff?
    ├─ YES → Transition to steady-state ops
    └─ NO → Extend monitoring period
```

## Communication

### Escalation Chain
1. **Engineering Lead** - Questions, moderate issues
2. **Data Ops** - Performance/infrastructure issues
3. **VP Engineering** - Critical incidents, rollback decisions
4. **All Hands** - Major incidents >15 min downtime

### Status Updates
- **Hourly**: Internal team log (no external notification)
- **Hour 8**: Brief update to leadership (status report)
- **Hour 24**: Final sign-off & transition plan

---

## What Happens After Hour 24

### If All Checks Pass (Expected)
1. Archive 24-hour monitoring logs
2. Transition to daily validation (once per day)
3. Begin 28-day stabilization period
4. Monitor for degradation patterns
5. Prepare optimization phase (if needed)

### Success = Transition to Steady-State Operations
- Move monitoring to daily schedule
- Archive cutover artifacts
- Update team documentation
- Schedule post-deployment retrospective
