# PR-393 Next Steps

This file contains the recommended next steps to complete Phase 1 and prepare the PR for review and merge.

1. Add helper docs to `docs/phase-1/` (this repo includes `PHASE-1-SUMMARY.md`).
2. Run CI checks and address any failures (dependency-validate, CodeQL, actionlint).
3. Convert PR #34 from Draft → Ready for review when helper docs are present.
4. Add reviewers: `@abaco-eng` and `@product-owner`.
5. Ensure labels are present: `phase-1`, `documentation`, `ci-cd`, `governance`.
6. Collect approvals and merge via squash-merge when ready.

If you want me to perform any of the above steps, reply with the number(s) (e.g., "Do 1,3").
