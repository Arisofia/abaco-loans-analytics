# CEO Operating System v2 — Executive Presentation (Oct-16, 2025)

## Scale confirmation
- **Scale:** Thousands (K). Sep-2025 AUM = **$7,368K** (baseline), Dec-2026 target = **$16,419K**.
- **Pattern:** Explicit month-by-month non-linear path (tough Q4-2025 trough, sharp Q1-2026 rebound, volatile Q2, acceleration Q3, consolidation Q4).

  - Unassigned: 2.95% ($1.4MM) — classify by Nov-2025.
- **Concentration:** Top-10 payers ~19.87% (below 30% covenant). Single-obligor ~4% ceiling respected.
- **Repayment pattern:** MOB1 8.50%; MOB2 43.98% (52.48% cumulative); MOB3 28.05% (80.53% cumulative); MOB4+ 17.81%; principal loss 1.66%; rotation 5.5x; embedded interest ~7.60% take-rate.
- **Default/DPD:**
  - Abaco Financial: high risk (multiple >90 DPD across sizes) — wind-down/contain.
  - Abaco Technologies: ~3–4% default, manageable; monitor >$150K segment.
- **Data quality:** ~78% complete; missing KAM assignments and some collateral details; ready for risk analysis and forecasting.

- **Phases:**
  - Q4-2025 Trough (seasonal + acquisition lag): -$903K from Sep baseline; prep platforms (LoanPro, Taktile, CRM) and embedded negotiations.
  - Q1-2026 Sharp Ramp: +$3,899K; embedded channels go live; 4 KAMs active; digital ramp.
  - Q2-2026 Volatile Growth: +$1,055K net; manage prepayment/churn; enforce Top-10 <30% and diversify buckets.
  - Q3-2026 Acceleration: +$3,084K; embedded channels 50–60% of originations; 300+ active customers; rotation stable.
  - Q4-2026 Consolidation: +$1,916K; shift to profitability, margin optimization, Series B readiness.
- **Customers:** Target 500 active SMEs (56 → 500 = 8.9x). Acquisition 35–40/month baseline rising to 50–60/month H1-2026; churn down to 15%; 5–10 reactivations/month.
- **Revenue/EBITDA (2026 ramp):** $2–3MM annual revenue equivalent with $50–100K EBITDA by Q4-2026; steady-state potential $270–390MM with 27%+ margins.
- **Defaults:** Maintain <1.5% per cohort (covenant ≤4%).
- **Rotation:** Sustain ≥4.5x (currently 5.5x).

## TAM and funnel
- **TAM:** LatAm B2B invoice market ~$200B; 3–5% factoring penetration → $6–10B; embedded capture ~1% → $60–100MM; Abaco 2026 target $16.4MM AUM = 16–27% of embedded slice.
- **Funnel (Sep-2025 → Dec-2026):**
  - Market: ~500K SMEs (payables $50–200K/month).
  - Aware: 155K SMEs (KAM + digital + embedded reach).
  - Registered: 56 now → 500 target (0.036% → 0.32% of aware).
  - Active: 56 now → 400 target (80% of registered).
  - Factoring: 56 now → 500 target (AUM per customer drops from $131K to ~$32.8K to favor small-bucket growth).
- **Government factoring:** None today; plan B2G pilot in 2027 after regulatory prep.

## Portfolio rebalancing targets (to reach $16.4MM)
- Shift growth to <$50K buckets with best LTV:CAC and diversification; reduce concentration in >$200K and $150–200K.
- Bucket deltas (current → target):
  - <$10K: $2.5MM → $4.0MM (+$1.5MM)
  - $10–25K: $5.7MM → $9.0MM (+$3.3MM)
  - $25–50K: $5.7MM → $8.5MM (+$2.8MM)
  - $50–75K: $6.1MM → $8.0MM (+$1.9MM)
  - $75–100K: $6.1MM → $7.0MM (+$0.9MM)
  - $100–150K: $2.9MM → $3.0MM (+$0.1MM)
  - $150–200K: $7.0MM → $6.5MM (-$0.5MM)
  - >$200K: $9.4MM → $8.4MM (-$1.0MM)
- Outcome: +$9.0MM net growth while keeping Top-10 <30%, improving LTV:CAC, and reducing default risk.
