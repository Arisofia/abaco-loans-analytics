# Disabled markdownlint rules

- MD013 (line length): Disabled to avoid spurious failures on wide tables and long config lines. Review planned Q4 2026 to re-enable.
- MD040 (fenced code block language): Disabled due to legacy code blocks missing language hints; aim to add languages to code fences and re-enable.
- MD060 (table column style): Disabled temporarily during table migration; plan to normalize table styles and re-enable.
