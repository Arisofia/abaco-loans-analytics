# GitHub Enterprise 30-Day Trial Playbook

This one-pager helps executives, admins, and delivery leads quickly capture value during a 30-day GitHub Enterprise Cloud trial. It curates the most relevant resources for governance, adoption, and ROI validation.

## Executive and admin briefings
- **Executive-level information**: Summaries and controls for leaders and administrators to evaluate security, compliance, and operational alignment (start with the Enterprise Cloud admin docs at https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin).
- **Quarterly product roadmap webinar**: Register for the latest roadmap sessions to stay ahead of upcoming platform capabilities and plan change management (https://resources.github.com/webcasts/ > "Roadmap" filter).
- **Forrester Wave™ recognition**: Review why GitHub is a leader in the Forrester Wave™ for DevOps platforms to benchmark against peer solutions (available under Analyst reports at https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/forrester-wave-devops-platforms/).

## Adoption and structure
- **Adoption guidance**: Follow proven deployment playbooks to accelerate onboarding, enforce policies, and land productivity wins within the trial window (https://resources.github.com/guides for adoption kits).
- **GitHub structure overview**: Map your enterprise org, teams, and repositories, including access models and governance patterns that scale (org and team patterns at https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations).
- **Documentation deep dive**: Analyze GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation to validate features, security controls, and operational runbooks (begin at https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest and use search or navigation to drill into security, compliance, and automation topics).

## Business impact and ROI
- **Total Economic Impact™ study**: Use the Forrester® TEI study to estimate cost savings, productivity gains, and risk reduction for your business case (https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/forrester-tei-github-enterprise-cloud/).
- **Value calculator**: Quantify how much money can be saved or earned by consolidating workflows on GitHub Enterprise Cloud (https://resources.github.com/value-calculator/).
- **What’s new**: Track recent releases and “See what’s new” updates to highlight immediate wins during the evaluation (https://github.blog/changelog/ or the "See what's new" area in GitHub Resources).

## Trial-ready usage checklist (30 days)
1. **Week 1** – Enable SSO/SCIM, configure branch protection, and invite pilot teams with starter repositories.

3. **Week 3** – Pilot automation (Actions, reusable workflows) and Copilot enterprise prompts aligned to your compliance controls.
4. **Week 4** – Collect executive-ready outcomes: productivity deltas, security findings resolved, and adoption feedback to inform purchase.
