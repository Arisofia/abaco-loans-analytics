## Slide 2: Where We’re Going (Dec-2026 Target)
- **Target AUM:** $16,419K by Dec-2026 (start $7,368K Sep-2025; +$9,051K growth, +122.8% CAGR, 15 months).
- **Non-linear path:** Trough → ramp → volatile → acceleration → consolidation.
  - Q4-25: Oct $7,171K (-2.7%), Nov $6,819K (-4.9%), Dec $6,465K (-5.5%) | total -12.3% (platform build, wind-down).
  - Q1-26: Jan $8,736K (+35.1% inflection, embedded live), Feb $8,814K (+0.9%), Mar $10,364K (+17.6%) | +60.3% vs Dec-2025 trough.
  - Q2-26: Apr $10,166K (-1.9%), May $11,629K (+14.4%), Jun $11,419K (-1.8%) | +16.3% net, volatile.
  - Q3-26: Jul $12,960K (+13.5%), Aug $12,860K (-0.8%), Sep $14,503K (+12.8%) | +27.1% acceleration.
  - Q4-26: Oct $14,511K (+0.1%), Nov $16,276K (+12.2%), Dec $16,419K (+0.9%) | +13.2% consolidation.
- **Market TAM validation (El Salvador, private-sector factoring):** 47,788 formal MSMEs (BCR 2024 dataset: 34,710 micro, 9,881 small, 3,197 medium). Applying average revenues ($60K / $600K / $3.5M) and a 15% receivables factor yields $2,880.1M of outstanding invoices; subtracting $141.0M B2G exposure (12% PAC 2023 × MIPYME quota) leaves $2,739.1M TAM net. With ~60-day rotation (~6x annually) and 75% eligibility, annualized TAM is ~$12,470M of financeable private-sector invoices.
- **Customer goal:** 500 active by Dec-26 (current 56; +444 net, 8.9x); 25-30 new/month baseline, churn 15-20/month, net +10-15 (30+ by Q3-26); 5-10 reactivations/month; mix ~150 New, 250 Recurrent, 100 Recovered.
- **Segment rebalancing:** >$200K bucket 19.87% → 10%; $100-200K hold 20-25%; $25-100K 25% → 40%; <$25K 10% → 25% to lift LTV:CAC and dilute concentration.
- **Target metrics (Dec-26):** Default <1.5%; Top-10 concentration 22%; single-obligor 2% (<4% policy); rotation ≥4.5x (today 5.5x); DPD mean <10 days; weighted APR 26-28%; utilization 70-75%; data quality >95%.
- **KPI governance & dashboards:** Owners and cadence logged in the CEO OS (finance owns capital/EBITDA; risk owns DPD/default/concentration; growth owns CAC/LTV/activation; product/ops own STP/T2F and data quality). All KPIs refreshed weekly with monthly board-grade snapshots. Dashboards include lineage, role-based permissions, and reconciliations.

- **Concentration breaches:** Cap <4% per client; gradual reductions; approval workflow for concentration.
- **Series B timing:** Breakeven H2-26; optional raise; preserve flexibility.
