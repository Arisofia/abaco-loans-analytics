# or contains: apps/web

# Verify git repository
git rev-parse --git-dir
# Expected: .git
```

**If any check fails**, refer to SETUP_GUIDE.md "Prerequisites" section.

---

### Step 2: Gather Required Secrets (20 min)

**Before running the setup script, collect these 7 secrets:**

#### Staging Secrets (3)

**2a. STAGING_SUPABASE_URL**
- Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Select **staging** project
- Click **Settings** → **API**
- Copy **Project URL** (example: `https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co`)
- Paste: `_______________________________________`

**2b. STAGING_SUPABASE_KEY**
- Same location: **Settings** → **API**
- Copy **anon public key** (starts with `eyJ`)
- Paste: `_______________________________________`

**2c. AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_TOKEN_STAGING**
- Go to https://portal.azure.com
- Find **Static Web App** (staging)
- Click **Manage deployment token**
- Copy token
- Paste: `_______________________________________`

#### Production Secrets (4)

**2d. PROD_SUPABASE_URL**
- Same as staging, but select **production** project
- Paste: `_______________________________________`

**2e. PROD_SUPABASE_KEY**
- Same as staging, but from **production** project
- Paste: `_______________________________________`

**2f. PROD_SENTRY_DSN**
- Go to https://sentry.io
- Navigate to **Settings** → **Projects** → Your Project → **Settings** → **Client Keys (DSN)**
- Copy DSN (example: `https://xxxx@xxxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxxx`)
- Or use placeholder if not using Sentry: `https://placeholder@placeholder.ingest.sentry.io/0`
- Paste: `_______________________________________`

**2g. AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_TOKEN_PROD**
- Same as staging, but for **production** Static Web App
- Paste: `_______________________________________`

**✓ All 7 secrets collected? Proceed to Step 3.**

---

### Step 3: Run Setup Script (30 min)

Navigate to the web app directory and execute the setup script:

```bash
cd /Users/jenineferderas/Documents/abaco-loans-analytics/apps/web
chmod +x .github/setup-secrets.sh
.github/setup-secrets.sh
```

**What the script does:**
1. Verifies you're in a git repository
2. Checks GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
3. Collects staging secrets (3)
4. Collects production secrets (4)
5. Creates all 7 secrets in GitHub
6. Verifies successful creation

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Git repository verified
✅ GitHub CLI installed
✅ GitHub CLI authenticated
... (collecting secrets)
✅ All 7 secrets created successfully
```

**If script fails**, check:
- Are you authenticated? Run: `gh auth login`
- Do you have repo admin access?
- Check troubleshooting in SETUP_GUIDE.md

**After script completes:** Continue to Step 4

---

### Step 4: Verify Secrets Created (10 min)

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI (preferred)**

```bash
gh secret list -R owner/repo
```

**Expected output** (all 7 should appear):
```
STAGING_SUPABASE_URL
STAGING_SUPABASE_KEY
AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_TOKEN_STAGING
PROD_SUPABASE_URL
PROD_SUPABASE_KEY
PROD_SENTRY_DSN
AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_TOKEN_PROD
```

**Option B: Using GitHub Web UI**

1. Go to: https://github.com/owner/repo/settings/secrets/actions
2. Verify you see all 7 secrets listed
3. (Values are hidden for security - you won't see them)

**✓ All 7 secrets visible? Proceed to Step 5.**

---

### Step 5: Create GitHub Environments (30 min)

GitHub needs to know what deployment environments exist. Create them in repository settings.

**Go to**: https://github.com/owner/repo/settings/environments

**Create Environment 1: staging**

1. Click **New environment**
2. Name: `staging`
3. Click **Configure environment**
4. Under "Deployment branches and tags" → Select "All branches and tags"
5. Click **Save protection rules**

**Create Environment 2: production**

1. Click **New environment**
2. Name: `production`
3. Click **Configure environment**
4. Under "Deployment branches and tags":
   - Select "Protected branches and tags"
   - Click **Add deployment branch or tag rule**
   - Pattern: `v*` (version tags only)
5. (Optional) Under "Reviewers": Add team leads for approval
6. Click **Save protection rules**

**Create Environment 3: production-rollback**

1. Click **New environment**
2. Name: `production-rollback`
3. Click **Configure environment**
4. Same settings as production
5. Click **Save protection rules**

**Verification:**

Go to https://github.com/owner/repo/settings/environments and confirm:
- [ ] staging (visible)
- [ ] production (with v* tag rule)
- [ ] production-rollback (with v* tag rule)

**✓ All 3 environments created? Proceed to Step 6.**

---

### Step 6: Verify Configuration Files (10 min)

The environment configuration files were created during initial setup. Verify they exist:

```bash
ls -la config/environments/
# Expected:
# staging.yml
# production.yml
```

**View contents to verify they're correct:**

```bash
cat config/environments/staging.yml
cat config/environments/production.yml
```

Both files should contain:
- environment name
- service URLs and keys (as ${VARIABLE} placeholders)
- feature flags
- deployment configuration

**✓ Both files exist and look correct? Proceed to Step 7.**

---

### Step 7: Verify Workflows Exist (10 min)

Verify all 5 GitHub Actions workflows are in place:

```bash
ls -la .github/workflows/
# Expected output shows:
# ci.yml
# deploy-staging.yml
# deploy-production.yml
# rollback.yml
# reusable-steps.yml
```

**Also verify in GitHub Web UI:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/owner/repo/actions
2. You should see 5 workflows listed in the left sidebar
3. Each should have a green checkmark (or pending if not triggered yet)

**✓ All 5 workflows visible? Proceed to Step 8.**

**Timeline:**
- Developer practice: 1.5 hours
- QA validation: 1.5 hours
- Production deployment practice: 2 hours
- Rollback practice: 1 hour

### 2.1: Developer Dry-Run (1.5 hours)

**Objective**: Practice CI pipeline with actual feature branch

**Step 1: Prepare development environment**

```bash
cd /Users/jenineferderas/Documents/abaco-loans-analytics/apps/web
git fetch origin
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
pnpm install
```

**Step 2: Create practice feature branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/ci-test-week2
```

**Step 3: Make a small change (to trigger CI)**

Edit any file, e.g., add a comment to package.json:

```bash
echo '# CI test branch - safe to delete' > CI_TEST.md
git add CI_TEST.md
git commit -m "test: CI pipeline validation for week 2 dry-run"
```

**Step 4: Run local quality checks**

```bash
pnpm check-all
npm test
pnpm build
```

**Expected**: All checks pass locally before pushing

**Step 5: Push branch and create PR**

```bash
git push origin feature/ci-test-week2
```

Then on GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/new/feature/ci-test-week2
2. Create PR against `develop` branch
3. Add title: "TEST: Week 2 CI dry-run"

# Push tag to GitHub
git push origin v0.1.0-test
```

**Step 2: Watch CI execute**

1. Go to https://github.com/owner/repo/actions
2. Look for new workflow run of `deploy-production.yml`
3. Watch it run through:
   - [ ] pre-deployment (version extraction)
   - [ ] quality-verification (full CI re-run)
   - [ ] approval-gate (waiting for approval)

**Step 3: Approve production deployment**

When you see "Waiting for approval" in the workflow:

1. Click the workflow run
2. Click **Review deployments**
3. Select **production** environment
4. Click **Approve and deploy**

**Expected**: Workflow continues with deployment

**Step 4: Watch deployment progress**

The workflow should now run:

**Step 7: Delete test tag**

Clean up the test tag (don't leave it):

```bash
git tag -d v0.1.0-test
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0-test
```

**This will:**
- Delete local tag
- Delete remote tag on GitHub
- Not affect the deployment (deployment is already done)

**✓ Production deployment practice complete!**

## WEEK 3: PRODUCTION READINESS (2-4 hours)

### Overview

Week 3 performs final verification and ensures the team is ready for production.

### 3.1: Final Configuration Review (1 hour)

**Step 1: Verify all secrets are still configured**

```bash
# Check secrets exist
gh secret list -R owner/repo

# Should show all 7 secrets
```

**Step 2: Test staging secrets (if possible)**

In a staging deployment workflow, add this diagnostic step:

```bash
# View environment variables (this logs them for verification)
env | grep STAGING
```

**Check GitHub Actions logs** to confirm staging secrets were injected correctly.

**Step 3: Verify GitHub environments**

Go to: https://github.com/owner/repo/settings/environments

Confirm all 3 environments exist:
- [ ] staging
- [ ] production (with v* tag rule)
- [ ] production-rollback (with v* tag rule)

**Step 4: Verify workflow files**

Check all 5 workflows exist and have correct content:

```bash
# Verify workflows can parse as valid YAML
for file in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
  echo "Checking $file..."
  # If you have yamllint installed, use it
  # Otherwise just verify files exist
done

# Count workflows
ls -1 .github/workflows/*.yml | wc -l
# Should output: 5
