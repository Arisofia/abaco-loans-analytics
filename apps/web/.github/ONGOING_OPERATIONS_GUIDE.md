## Daily Operations (30 minutes)

### Morning Checklist (First 10 minutes of day)

Every morning, verify system health:

```bash
# 1. Check production is responding
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP Status: %{http_code}\n" \
  https://abaco-loans-analytics.com

# 2. Check build status
# Go to: https://github.com/owner/repo/actions
# Verify: Last workflow run shows ✅ green

# 3. Check Sentry for overnight errors
# Go to: https://sentry.io
# Check: "Last 24 hours" filter
# Expected: < 5 errors (or 0)

# 4. Verify no deployments failed
# Go to: https://github.com/owner/repo/releases
# Check: Latest version is still active
```

**If all checks pass**: Continue normal work
**If any check fails**: See troubleshooting section

### Continuous Monitoring (Ongoing)

Keep these tabs open during work hours:

**Sentry Dashboard** (Active monitoring)
- Check every 2 hours
- Watch for error spikes
- Monitor specific endpoints
- Track error trends

**GitHub Actions** (Deployment monitoring)
- Check when PRs are merged
- Watch CI pipeline completion
- Verify no unexpected failures
- Monitor build times

**Slack Alerts** (Notification hub)
- Watch #prod-alerts for notifications
- Watch #incidents for critical issues
- Respond to #dev-help questions
- Share helpful tips in #dev-help

### End-of-Day Checklist (Last 5 minutes of day)

Before leaving:

```
[ ] No critical errors in Sentry
[ ] All workflows show ✅ (no red X)
[ ] Production URL responds (HTTP 200)
[ ] No incidents opened today (or all resolved)
[ ] #prod-alerts has no outstanding issues

If all checked: Good to go!
If any unchecked: Investigate before leaving
```

## Common Operational Issues

### Issue 1: High Error Rate Spike

**Symptoms**: Sentry shows 100+ errors in last hour (unusual)

**Immediate Steps** (< 5 min):
1. Open Sentry dashboard
2. Filter: "Last 1 hour"
3. Check if errors are from same endpoint
4. Read error stack traces
5. Determine if critical or benign

**If Critical** (users affected):
1. Page DevOps lead
2. Check application logs
3. Determine if rollback needed
4. Rollback if unable to determine cause
5. Create incident report

**If Benign** (not user-impacting):
1. Document error pattern
2. Create GitHub issue to fix
3. No rollback needed
4. Monitor for 30 minutes
5. Move to backlog

### Issue 2: Slow Response Times

**Symptoms**: Average response time > 1 second (unusual)

**Investigation**:
1. Check Sentry for errors (might be causing slowness)
2. Check monitoring graphs for time of issue
3. Check if specific endpoint is slow
4. Check database query logs
5. Check for traffic spike

**Solutions**:
- If temporary spike: Wait for traffic to normalize
- If persistent: Investigate and fix in code
- If database issue: Scale database or optimize queries
- If code issue: Create high-priority bug fix

### Issue 3: Deployment Approval Hangs

**Symptoms**: Approval gate stuck for > 10 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Refresh GitHub Actions page
2. Navigate to specific workflow run
3. Scroll to "Review deployments"
4. Click "Approve and deploy" button
5. If button doesn't appear, check environment settings

**Prevention**:
- Check GitHub environment "production" is configured
- Verify approval rules are set
- Test approval process in staging first

### Issue 4: Staging Not Deploying After Merge

**Symptoms**: Code merged to develop, but staging deploy didn't trigger

**Investigation**:
1. Check: Was merge to correct branch? (should be `develop`)
2. Check: Did merge have actual code changes?
3. Check: Are paths filtered in workflow? (check deploy-staging.yml)
4. Check: Is deploy-staging.yml workflow enabled?

**Solutions**:
- Manual trigger: Go to Actions → deploy-staging → Run workflow
- Check workflow file for path filters
- Verify branch is correct
- Check if workflow is enabled in settings

### Issue 5: CI Failing Intermittently

**Symptoms**: CI passes locally, fails in GitHub Actions (random)

**Common Causes**:
1. Race conditions in tests
2. Environment variable missing
3. Port already in use
4. Flaky test
5. Timing issue

**Fix**:
1. Run tests locally multiple times: `npm test -- --maxWorkers=1`
2. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error
3. Add retries to flaky tests
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Check environment configuration

## Incident Response Procedures

### When to Create an Incident

Create incident if:
- [ ] Production is down (HTTP != 200)
- [ ] Error rate > 5%
- [ ] Critical feature broken
- [ ] Security concern
- [ ] Data loss/corruption
- [ ] Performance degraded > 50%

Do NOT create incident for:
- [ ] Minor bug in non-critical feature
- [ ] Cosmetic UI issue
- [ ] Single error event
- [ ] Expected maintenance

### P1 Incident (Critical - Immediate Action)

**Definition**: Production down or critical feature completely broken

**Actions** (First 5 minutes):
1. [ ] Page on-call team immediately
2. [ ] Create incident in #incidents
3. [ ] Determine rollback vs fix
4. [ ] Execute rollback if needed (< 5 min)
5. [ ] Establish war room (Slack thread or call)

**During Incident** (Ongoing):
1. [ ] Post updates every 5 minutes
2. [ ] Coordinate fix team
3. [ ] Deploy fix or rollback
4. [ ] Verify health checks
5. [ ] Monitor for 15 minutes

**After Incident** (Within 2 hours):
1. [ ] Post all-clear notification
2. [ ] Schedule post-mortem (within 24 hours)
3. [ ] Create action items
4. [ ] Document what happened
5. [ ] Communicate to stakeholders

### P2 Incident (High - Quick Response)

**Definition**: Significant feature broken or impacting users

**Response Time**: < 30 minutes to response

**Actions**:
1. [ ] Create GitHub issue with "incident" label
2. [ ] Post in #incidents
3. [ ] Coordinate fix with team
4. [ ] Determine if rollback needed
5. [ ] Deploy fix (if quick) or rollback
6. [ ] Verify in staging first
7. [ ] Monitor for 1 hour

### P3 Incident (Medium - Standard Response)

**Definition**: Non-critical feature broken or workaround exists

**Response Time**: < 4 hours

**Actions**:
1. [ ] Create GitHub issue
2. [ ] Plan fix in sprint
3. [ ] Communicate workaround (if exists)
4. [ ] Monitor for regression

### P4 Incident (Low - Backlog)

**Definition**: Minor issue, cosmetic, or workaround exists

**Response Time**: Next sprint

**Actions**:
1. [ ] Create GitHub issue
2. [ ] Add to backlog
3. [ ] Schedule fix
4. [ ] Low priority

## Performance Optimization

### Monthly Performance Review

First Friday of each month, review:

**Load Testing Results**:
```
Simulate: 100 concurrent users
Measure:
- Response time: [XXX]ms
- Error rate: [X]%
- Max connections: [XX]

If exceeding targets:
1. Identify bottleneck (code, DB, network)
2. Create optimization backlog items
3. Plan improvements
4. Schedule testing after deployment
```

**Database Query Performance**:
```
Check slow query logs:
- Queries > 1 second: [list]
- Missing indexes: [list]
- N+1 problems: [list]

Actions:
1. Add missing indexes
2. Optimize slow queries
3. Cache frequently accessed data
4. Archive old data
```

**Client-Side Performance**:
```
Measure with Lighthouse:
- Performance score: [0-100]
- Target: 90+
- If < 85:
  1. Identify issue (image size, JS, CSS)
  2. Optimize
  3. Re-test

Measure Core Web Vitals:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
```

## Metrics Tracking Template

Create spreadsheet with this structure:

```
DATE         | UPTIME  | AVG RESP | ERROR% | INCIDENTS | DEPLOYMENTS | NOTES
2025-12-26   | 100%    | 245ms   | 0.0%  | 0         | 1 (v1.0.0)  | First release
2025-12-27   | 99.9%   | 267ms   | 0.0%  | 0         | 0           | Monitoring
2025-12-28   | 100%    | 234ms   | 0.0%  | 0         | 0           | All stable
...
WEEKLY AVG   | 99.97%  | 258ms   | 0.0%  | 0         | 1           | Healthy week
```

**Review Monthly**:
- Is uptime trending up or down?
- Are response times stable?
- Is error rate acceptable?
- Are deployment frequency and success rate improving?
