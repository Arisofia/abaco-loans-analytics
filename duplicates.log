Detailed help for jdupes -X/--ext-filter options
General format: jdupes -X filter[:value][size_suffix]

noext:ext1[,ext2,...]   	Exclude files with certain extension(s)

onlyext:ext1[,ext2,...] 	Only include files with certain extension(s)

size[+-=]:size[suffix]  	Only Include files matching size criteria
                        	Size specs: + larger, - smaller, = equal to
                        	Specs can be mixed, i.e. size+=:100k will
                        	only include files 100KiB or more in size.

nostr:text_string       	Exclude all paths containing the string
onlystr:text_string     	Only allow paths containing the string
                        	HINT: you can use these for directories:
                        	-X nostr:/dir_x/  or  -X onlystr:/dir_x/
newer:datetime          	Only include files newer than specified date
older:datetime          	Only include files older than specified date
                        	Date/time format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
                        	Time is optional (remember to escape spaces!)

Some filters take no value or multiple values. Filters that can take
a numeric option generally support the size multipliers K/M/G/T/P/E
with or without an added iB or B. Multipliers are binary-style unless
the -B suffix is used, which will use decimal multipliers. For example,
16k or 16kib = 16384; 16kb = 16000. Multipliers are case-insensitive.

Filters have cumulative effects: jdupes -X size+:99 -X size-:101 will
cause only files of exactly 100 bytes in size to be included.

Extension matching is case-insensitive.
Path substring matching is case-sensitive.
