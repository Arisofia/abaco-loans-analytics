# Contributing Guidelines

## Creating a PR
1. **Squash on merge**: Use squash-and-merge to keep the main branch history clean.
2. **Logical commits welcome**: Keep commits focused; related changes can be grouped, but final merge will squash to one commit on main.
3. **Reviews**: Add yourself as assignee and request required reviewers (@codex, @sourcery, @coderabbit, @sonarqube, @gemini, @zencoder).
4. **Quality gates**: Ensure CI, SonarCloud, and lint/tests pass before requesting merge.
