## Priority Distribution

- **Critical (15)**: Syntax, schema, hardcoded secrets, required workflow fields
- **High (32)**: Job execution, integrations, major features
- **Medium (20)**: Non-critical features, optional integrations
- **Low (8)**: Performance, warnings, nice-to-have features

---

## Test Execution Order

1. **Phase 1**: Syntax validation (WF-SYN-*, WF-STRUCT-*) - ~2 minutes
2. **Phase 2**: Environment & secrets (WF-ENV-*) - ~1 minute
3. **Phase 3**: Trigger validation (WF-TRIG-*) - ~1 minute
4. **Phase 4**: Workflow-specific tests (WF-CI-*, WF-DEPLOY-*, etc.) - ~15 minutes
5. **Phase 5**: Performance testing (WF-PERF-*) - ~30 minutes
6. **Phase 6**: Integration testing (partial tests) - ~60 minutes

**Total Test Suite Duration**: ~120 minutes (fully automated) + manual integration validation
