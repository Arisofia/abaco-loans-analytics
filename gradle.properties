# This file sets project-specific Gradle properties.

# For more details, see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html

# Note: Avoid hardcoding org.gradle.java.home to a machine-specific path to keep the
# build portable across environments. Developers should rely on JAVA_HOME or Gradle's
# toolchain resolution instead of forcing a single JDK location in version control.
