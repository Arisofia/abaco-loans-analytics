# This file sets project-specific Gradle properties.

#
# Prefer Gradle's toolchain resolution over hardcoding org.gradle.java.home, which ties
# the build to a single machine path. Keep builds portable across macOS, Linux, and CI.
# Ensure your shell or CI exports JAVA_HOME/GRADLE_JAVA_HOME to supported JDK installs.
# Gradle will auto-detect those installs and select the matching toolchain per build.
# Avoid committing machine-specific JDK paths; rely on env vars plus toolchain settings.
# This keeps developers, CI runners, and release builds aligned on the same LTS JDKs.
# Configure JAVA_HOME/GRADLE_JAVA_HOME via dev environment or CI secrets, not in VCS.
# Toolchain version targets live in build.gradle to keep enforcement centralized.
# If multiple JDKs are present, Gradle picks the matching toolchain without manual switching.
