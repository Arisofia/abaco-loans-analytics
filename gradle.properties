# Note: Avoid hardcoding org.gradle.java.home to a machine-specific path to keep the
# build portable across environments. Developers should rely on JAVA_HOME or Gradle's
# toolchain resolution instead of forcing a single JDK location in version control.

# Rely on the project's Java toolchain (configured in build.gradle) instead of hardcoding
# a local JDK path that may not exist in all environments.
# Prefer JDKs provided via JAVA_HOME/GRADLE_JAVA_HOME to keep Gradle on a supported LTS runtime.
